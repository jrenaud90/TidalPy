**Tidal Dynamics and Thermal-Orbital Evolution Software Suite Implemented in Cython and Python**

TidalPy is an open-source software suite that utilizes a semi-analytic approach to estimate tidal heating,
orbit-rotation evolution, and thermal changes for rocky and icy worlds. It has been used to simulate the thermal-orbital
evolution of moons within our Solar System as well as exoplanets beyond. TidalPy's `RadialSolver` package can accurately
estimate the viscoelastic Love and Shida numbers for a multi-layered world, including the effects of liquid layers,
compressibility, dynamic tides, and advanced rheological models. This model has been used to study the tidal response
of Mercury, Venus, Earth, our Moon, and Mars.

However, if you want high fidelity tidal, orbital, spin, and interior models --- then you have come to the right place!
Read below for instructions on how to install and use TidalPy.

# How to Install

## Compatibility

*As of TidalPy v0.5.0*:

* **Windows-Latest**: *Installation & tests passed.*
* **MacOS-Latest**: *Installation & tests passed.*
* **Ubuntu-Latest**: *Installation & tests passed.*

## Basic Installation

Installing TidalPy is ass simple as ensuring 64-bit [Python 3.9+](https://www.python.org/) is installed on your 
system and performing the following in a terminal:

`pip install TidalPy`

_TidalPy can not currently be installed via `conda install`._

## Accessing Jupyter Notebooks
There are several jupyter notebooks with TidalPy demos found in the /Demos/ folder of this repository.
In order to access these you will need to make sure you install Jupyter and a few related packages:

`pip install ipympl ipython ipywidgets jupyter`

or 

`conda install ipympl ipython ipywidgets jupyter`

You can then clone this GitHub repository,

`git clone https://github.com/jrenaud90/TidalPy`

to a local directory. Navigate to this directory and the `Demos` sub-directory then access the notebooks by using the command,
`jupyter notebook`.

## Cartopy

TidalPy offers the ability to make nice 2D plots using the [cartopy](https://scitools.org.uk/cartopy/docs/latest/index.html) package for some of 
3d projection map plotting. In turn, cartopy relies on [GEOS](https://trac.osgeo.org/geos/) which is not a python
package and must be installed outside of pip.

The easiest way to install cartopy is using an Anaconda environment by,

`conda install -c conda-forge cartopy`

If you are not using a conda environment then you will need to find and install the GEOS binaries manually:

**Windows:** [Follow instructions here](https://trac.osgeo.org/osgeo4w/)
**On Ubuntu:** `sudo apt-get install libgeos-dev`
**On MacOS:** `brew install geos`

After GEOS is installed you can pip install the rest,

`pip install pyproj shapely pyshp cartopy`

## DiffEqPy / Julia

TidalPy provides the option to use the [Julia](https://julialang.org/) programming language's differential equation 
solver for python: [diffeqpy](https://github.com/SciML/diffeqpy). To utilize this package you first need to ensure
that Julia is installed on your machine and available via the system's environment path.

* Install the Julia language from [https://julialang.org/downloads/](https://julialang.org/downloads/)
* Add Julia's directory and its `bin` subdirectory to your system's path.
* Open an elevated ("as administrator") terminal, command prompt, or powershell.
  * If you are using a virtual Python environment make sure it is active.
* Install `julia` and `diffeqpy` for python using pip
  * Run `pip install julia diffeqpy`
* Open Python on your elevated terminal (the following steps may take a while to compile). 
  * Run `import julia; julia.install(); import diffeqpy; diffeqpy.install()`

## Installation Troubleshooting

_If you ran into a problem that is not listed below please [submit an issue](https://github.com/jrenaud90/TidalPy/issues) and we will work on addressing it!_

**Known Problems:**
* The `setuptools` package is required before TidalPy can be installed. Usually it is automatically installed, but if
  you are starting with a clean virtual environment it may not have been.
  * For Anaconda: `conda install setuptools`
  * Or for regular Python: `pip install setuptools`

# How to Use TidalPy

Check out the `Documentation\Getting Started.md` file. This is pretty bare bones at the moment but offers some basic
info about TidalPy. For now the best way to learn how to use TidalPy is by checking out the `Demos` directory. There
are "beginner" [Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org/) that are a great starting point.
