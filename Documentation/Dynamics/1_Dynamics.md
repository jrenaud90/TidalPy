# TidalPy Dynamics

TidalPy's dynamics API is currently undergoing changes, this documentation will be updated once it is complete. For the
time being please take a look at the autogenerated API documentation.

As of TidalPy v0.7.0, the dynamics functionality is spread between `TidalPy.dynamics` and `TidalPy.tides` modules. This
will be refactored into a new `TidalPy.Dynamics` module (with a capital).
