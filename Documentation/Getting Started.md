# Getting Started with TidalPy

## Installation
Please see the package's `readme.md` file for the most up to date installation information.
You can find this file, along with the project's source code, at its [GitHub page](https://github.com/jrenaud90/TidalPy).

## After Installation
At the current stage of `TidalPy` development things are changing too rapidly to make a comprehensive getting started guide, sorry!

For now look to the `Cookbooks` examples on how to use `TidalPy`. If you find any issues or have an idea about a new feature then feel free to leave a new github issue [here](https://github.com/jrenaud90/TidalPy/issues). Stuck on a problem or have a question? Feel free to contact joe.p.renaud@gmail.com try to include a minimal working snippet of code (if relevant to your question).
