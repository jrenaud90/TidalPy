# For solid-solid layer interfaces all of the radial functions are continuous.
# Since the solid solutions do not lose a y or an independent solution when moving from dynamic to static: Then the
#    interfaces between static-dynamic or dynamic-static will also fully continuous.
# TODO: Is this true for layers that experience a density jump/drop?
# In all likely hood you probably will not want to use these as true interfaces. Instead just combining all adjacent
#    "solid" layers into one super layer.
