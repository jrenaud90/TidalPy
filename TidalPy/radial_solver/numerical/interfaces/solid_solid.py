""" Functions to calculate the initial conditions for an overlying solid layer above another solid layer.

For solid-solid layer interfaces, all radial functions are continuous.

Since the solid solutions do not lose a y or an independent solution when moving from dynamic to static: Then the
interfaces between static-dynamic or dynamic-static will also be fully continuous.

In all likely-hood you probably will not want to use these as true interfaces. Instead, just combining all adjacent
"solid" layers into one super solid layer.
