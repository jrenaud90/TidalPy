# Version number should always be updated before pushing to git
# Version number should have the following format:
# A.B.C<desc>
#     A = Major Release: May break backwards compatibility
#     B = Minor Release: New features but not critical, should be backwards compatible to previous minor releases
#     C = Bug/Hot Fixes: Bug fixes or very minor features and improvements
# 1.2.0dev1   # Development Build
# 1.2.0a1     # Alpha Build
# 1.2.0b1     # Beta Release
# 1.2.0rc1    # Release Candidate
# 1.2.X       # Final Release (X are bug fixes and patches that do not fall on the regular release cycle)
