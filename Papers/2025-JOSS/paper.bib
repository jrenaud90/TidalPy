Here we revisit the problem of the numerical evaluation of loading and tidal LNs in the static limit for an incompressible planetary body, adopting a Laplace inversion scheme based upon the Post-Widder formula as an alternative to the traditional viscoelastic normal modes method. We also consider, within the same framework, complex-valued, frequency-dependent LNs that describe the response to a periodic forcing, which are paramount in the study of the tidal deformation of planets. Furthermore, we numerically obtain the time-derivatives of LNs, suitable for modelling geodetic signals in response to surface loads variations. A number of examples are shown, in which time and frequency-dependent LNs are evaluated for the Earth and planets adopting realistic rheological profiles. The numerical solution scheme is implemented in ALMA3 (the plAnetary Love nuMbers cAlculator, version 3), an upgraded open-source Fortran 90 program that computes the LNs for radially layered planetary bodies with a wide range of rheologies, including transient laws like Andrade or Burgers.},

  abstract = {Temporal variations of surface masses, such as the hydrosphere and atmosphere of the Earth, load the surfaces of planetary bodies causing temporal variations in deformation. Surface shear forces and gravitational fields also drive ongoing planetary deformation. Characterizing the spatiotemporal patterns of planetary deformation can constrain allowable models for the interior structure of a planetary body as well as for the distribution of surface and body forces. Pertinent applications include hydrology, glaciology, geodynamics, atmospheric science, and climatology. To address the diversity of emerging applications, we introduce a software suite called               LoadDef               that provides a collection of modular functions for modeling planetary deformation within a self-consistent,               Python               -based computational framework. Key features of               LoadDef               include computation of real-valued potential, load, and shear Love numbers for self-gravitating and spherically symmetric planetary models; computation of Love-number partial derivatives with respect to planetary density and elastic structure; computation of displacement, gravity, tilt, and strain load Green's functions; and computation of three-component surface displacements induced by surface mass loading. At a most basic level, only a planetary-structure model and a mass-load model must be supplied as input to               LoadDef               to utilize all the main features of the software. The end-to-end forward-modeling capabilities for mass-loading applications lay the foundation for sensitivity studies and geodetic tomography.               LoadDef               results have been validated with Global Navigation Satellite System observations and verified against independent software and published results. As a case study, we use               LoadDef               to predict the solid Earth's elastic response to ocean tidal loading across the western United States.                        ,              Plain Language Summary             The Earth and other planets are continually stretched and compressed due to changes in gravity and surface pressure. The amount of distortion that a planet experiences depends on the nature of the force as well as on the interior structure of the planet. We have developed a software package, called LoadDef, that models how the shapes of planets become altered when acted upon by various forces, including gravity and the weights of surface fluids. Examples of surface fluids include the atmosphere, fresh-water reservoirs, and the oceans. As the ocean tides ebb and flow, for instance, the pressure on the ocean floor changes. Due to the changes in pressure, the surface of the Earth compresses downward and decompresses upward with time, much like the push of a finger could indent a foam ball. The amount of surface compression depends not only on the changing weight of the water, but also on the density and elasticity of rocks inside the Earth. In essence, LoadDef can predict how the different forces interact with a planetary body to cause distortion. Applications of the software span a variety of fields, including climate science, natural hazards, hydrology, geodynamics, and planetary science.           ,              Key Points                                                                We introduce a software to model elastic planetary deformation driven by gravitational fields, surface mass loading, and shear forcing                                                                          LoadDef                     computes real-valued potential, load, and shear Love numbers, as well as Love-number partial derivatives for sensitivity studies                                                                                             LoadDef                     performs end-to-end forward modeling of planetary surface displacements generated by surface mass loading},

  abstract = {Abstract             Body tides reveal information about planetary interiors and affect their evolution. Most models to compute body tides rely on the assumption of a spherically symmetric interior. However, several processes can lead to lateral variations of interior properties. We present a new spectral method to compute the tidal response of laterally heterogeneous bodies. Compared to previous spectral methods, our approach is not limited to small-amplitude lateral variations; compared to finite element codes, this approach is more computationally efficient. While the tidal response of a spherically symmetric body has the same wavelength as the tidal force; lateral heterogeneities produce an additional tidal response with a~spectra that depends on the spatial pattern of such variations. For Mercury, the Moon, and Io, the amplitude of this signal is as high as 1\%--10\% of the main tidal response for long-wavelength shear modulus variations higher than {$\sim$}10\% of the mean shear modulus. For Europa, Ganymede, and Enceladus, shell-thickness variations of 50\% of the mean shell thickness can cause an additional signal of {$\sim$}1\% and {$\sim$}10\% for the Jovian moons and Encelaudus, respectively. Future missions, such as BepiColombo and JUICE, might measure these signals. Lateral variations of viscosity affect the distribution of tidal heating. This can drive the thermal evolution of tidally active bodies and affect the distribution of active regions.},

  abstract = {Solid body tides provide key information on the interior structure, evolution, and origin of the planetary bodies. Our Solar system harbours a very diverse population of planetary bodies, including those composed of rock, ice, gas, or a mixture of all. While a rich arsenal of geophysical methods has been developed over several years to infer knowledge about the interior of the Earth, the inventory of tools to investigate the interiors of other Solar-system bodies remains limited. With seismic data only available for the Earth, the Moon, and Mars, geodetic measurements, including the observation of the tidal response, have become especially valuable and therefore, has played an important role in understanding the interior and history of several Solar system bodies. To use tidal response measurements as a means to obtain constraints on the interior structure of planetary bodies, appropriate understanding of the viscoelastic reaction of the materials from which the planets are formed is needed. Here, we review the fundamental aspects of the tidal modeling and the information on the present-day interior properties and evolution of several planets and moons based on studying their tidal response. We begin with an outline of the theory of viscoelasticity and tidal response. Next, we proceed by discussing the information on the tidal response and the inferred structure of Mercury, Venus, Mars and its moons, the Moon, and the largest satellites of giant planets, obtained from the analysis of the data that has been provided by space missions. We also summarise the upcoming possibilities offered by the currently planned missions.},

  abstract = {The advanced rheological models of Andrade and Sundberg \& Cooper are compared to the traditional Maxwell model to understand how each affects the tidal dissipation of heat within rocky bodies. We find both Andrade and Sundberg--Cooper rheologies can produce at least 10\texttimes{} the tidal heating compared to a traditional Maxwell model for a warm (1400--1600 K) Io-like satellite. Sundberg--Cooper can cause even larger dissipation around a critical temperature and frequency. These models allow cooler planets to stay tidally active in the face of orbital perturbations---a condition we term "tidal resilience." This has implications for the time evolution of tidally active worlds and the long-term equilibria they fall into. For instance, if Io's interior is better modeled by the Andrade or Sundberg--Cooper rheologies, the number of possible resonance-forming scenarios that still produce a hot, modern Io is expanded, and these scenarios do not require an early formation of the Laplace resonance. The two primary empirical parameters that define the Andrade anelasticity are examined in several phase spaces to provide guidance on how their uncertainties impact tidal outcomes, as laboratory studies continue to constrain their real values. We provide detailed reference tables on the fully general equations required for others to insert the models of Andrade and Sundberg--Cooper into standard tidal formulae. Lastly, we show that advanced rheologies can greatly impact the heating of short-period exoplanets and exomoons, while the properties of tidal resilience could mean a greater number of tidally active worlds among all extrasolar systems.},
