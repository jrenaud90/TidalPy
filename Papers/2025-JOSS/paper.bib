abstract = {Dynamic, interpreted languages, like Python, are attractive for domain-experts and scientists experimenting with new ideas. However, the performance of the interpreter is often a barrier when scaling to larger data sets. This paper presents a just-in-time compiler for Python that focuses in scientific and array-oriented computing. Starting with the simple syntax of Python, Numba compiles a subset of the language into efficient machine code that is comparable in performance to a traditional compiled language. In addition, we share our experience in building a JIT compiler using LLVM[1].},

  abstract = {Dissipation of tidal energy in the earth's mantle and the moon was calculated assuming a dissipation factor 1/Q constant throughout both bodies. In the mantle the dissipation varies from about 2 \texttimes{} 10-6/Q erg cm-3 sec-1 near the pole at the bottom of the mantle to about 0.02 \texttimes{} 10-6/Q erg cm-3 sec-1 near the surface. The effects of compressibility and inhomogeneity are less than 3\%. In a homogeneous moon the dissipation varies from a maximum of about 0.03 \texttimes{} 10-6/Q erg cm-3 sec-1 near the center to a minimum of about 0.4 \texttimes{} 10-9/Q erg cm-3 sec-1 at the surface. A theory of orbital evolution is developed in which the disturbing function is expressed in a Fourier series with respect to time, so that the effects of variation of dissipation factor 1/Q, or lag angle {$\epsilon$}, with amplitude and frequency can be examined. Comparisons with results of other authors are made.},

            SymPy is an open-source computer algebra system written in pure Python. It is built with a focus on extensibility and ease of use, through both interactive and programmatic applications. These characteristics have led SymPy to become a popular symbolic library for the scientific Python ecosystem. This paper presents the architecture of SymPy, a description of its features, and a discussion of select submodules. The supplementary material provides additional examples and further outlines details of the architecture and features of SymPy.
